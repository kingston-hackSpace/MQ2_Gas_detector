# MQ2 Gas detector 

The MQ2 is a gas sensor that detects the presence of certain gases by changing its internal resistance.
It’s a chemiresistor, meaning its electrical resistance changes when exposed to specific gases.

Commonly used in safety and home automation projects for detecting leaks and smoke.

*Note: The sensor becomes very **hot** after a while, don’t touch it!*

### HOW IT WORKS? 

THE MQ2 can detect gases when their concentrations are between 200 and 10,000 parts per million (ppm).

### WHICH GAS?
It can detect:
- LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)
- smoke
- alcohol
- propane
- hydrogen
- methane
- carbon monoxide

*NOTE! The MQ2 can detect many gases, but it cannot identify which one specifically. It only tells you that gas concentration has changed.*
